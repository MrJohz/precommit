Usage:
  precommit [OPTIONS]
  precommit list
  precommit check [CHECK_OPTIONS] [--status <status command>] [--diff <diff command>]

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

Commands:
  list   List all files with staged changes
  check  Run commands to validate the staged changes

Check Options:
  -j, --jobs <N>      Set the maximum number of parallel processes that will be
                      spawned (defaults to the number of processors)
  -I <PLACEHOLDER>    Any instance of the string <PLACEHOLDER> in the command string
                      will be replaced by the filename of the staged file before the
                      command is executed.  (defaults to '{{}}')
  -s, --status <CMD>  Adds a command that will be run once for each file with the
                      file's staged contents piped to STDIN.  If this command returns
                      a non-zero status code, the validation is considered a failure.
                      This option may be passed multiple times.
  -d, --diff <CMD>    Adds a command that will be run once for each file with the
                      file's staged contents piped to STDIN.  If this command returns
                      a non-zero status code, or if the command's STDOUT does not
                      match the file's contents, the validation is considered a
                      failure.  This option may be passed multiple times.
